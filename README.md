# Capstone project: Sneakers Shop 

Within this repository you will find a HTML/CSS3 implementation of a sneakers shop, following the design guidelines proposed by [Dima Oxygen](https://www.behance.net/dimaoxygen) for Axel Arigato as presented in [this](https://www.behance.net/gallery/80392909/AXEL-ARIGATO-Website) website. 

## Getting started

No live version was deployed yet, so, in order to view the page, you must clone the repository using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chincoya/Capstone-Sneakers-Shop
```

Then, you can run it in any browser that supports flexbox layout and it's properties as well as
```javascript
document.addEventListener("event", func);
```
syntax. 

## Insights
The main page is rendered as a long strip of content with overflow hidden, and is navigable by using the mouse wheel or a finger in a touchscreen. The sections that comprise several parts are presented in some sort od horizontal slideshow, this one navigable with the mouse as well as with a finger. Most of this behavior was made with javascript modifiyng the transform property of elements.
